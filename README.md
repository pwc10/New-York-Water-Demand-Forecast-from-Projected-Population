# New-York-Water-Demand-Forecast-from-Projected-Population

This was a scenario I had simply formed from one of my projects in my graduate program from NYU. It is a very general analysis of how New York City's water demand would increase as there is increase in population. With the water demand data from 2015 and New York population data accessible online, a simple forecasting method was used to project the number of population until year 2100. With the population growth %, this growth percentage was applied to the water demand data to obtain the projected water demand value until year 2100.

Keep in mind that this scenario was only formulated by ONLY by linking population with water demand, therefore it is a bit broad. There are other important factors that can alter the water demand such as water saving campaigns, newly introduced water efficient systems, and also because of the pandemic, where continued decline was likely driven by the increased prevalence of work-from-home-options in non-residential sectors.

Further detail will be shared in the report attached in this repository and the code will also be available.
