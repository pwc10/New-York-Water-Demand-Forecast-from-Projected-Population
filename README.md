# New-York-Water-Demand-Forecast-from-Projected-Population

This was a scenario I had simply formed from one of my projects in my graduate program from NYU. It is a very general analysis of how New York City's water demand would increase as there is increase in population.

Keep in mind that this scenario was only formulated by ONLY by linking population with water demand, therefore it is a bit broad. There are other important factors that can alter the water demand such as water saving campaigns, newly introduced water efficient systems, and also because of the pandemic, where continued decline was likely driven by the increased prevalence of work-from-home-options in non-residential sectors.

Further detail will be shared in the report attached in this repository.

As an addition, I wrote a simple forecasting method using Python to project the number of population until year 2100. This was just for me to see the difference between just estimating the population growth from past data and analyzing past data to project a possible pattern.

The code is also available in this repository.
